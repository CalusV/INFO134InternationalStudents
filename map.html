                The Academic Quarter, also called the Quarter, is the student's
                cultural center in Bergen. The name is a word game, as academic
                quarter is traditionally the name in which circles formed have
                put on delays that one should look through the fingers, while a
                quartet means a quarter. Every year there are a large number of
                events in the neighborhood, ranging from board games to concerts.

                Garage is a bar with hangout in Bergen (previously a department
                also in Oslo, see below) with its own concert department.
                The Bergens department was founded in 1990 by veterans in the
                Bergens rock environment, had from the beginning of the rock
                profile and soon became one of the city's most popular nightlife,
                especially among students. Due to municipal rules on opening
                hours, the bar room was divided into two separate departments
                with different opening hours for several years.

              Club Inside started in 2nd set in 2003 and soon established itself
              as a "slightly different" night out in the heart of Bergen.
              Inside Rock cafe opened its doors in the 1st of the fall of 2004
              and was soon one of the mountain's most popular places for those
              who were fond of rock.
              Our music is and has been guitar based, something we will always
              have as a red thread. Inside has been visited by many great
              artists / bands and we have received a lot of praise for the
              concept, as well as our food.
              If you are visiting and want to impress friends, we recommend
              that you try an "Inside" shot. This swirls with 1.2 million
              scoville on the tongue. Guaranteed Norway's strongest!

              Bryggen in Bergen, also known as the German Bridge and
              Hansabryggen, encompasses the old wooded and fire-resistant stone
              jellers in the historic city center of Bergen. Bryggen was built
              around 1070, and was from 1360 to 1754 the seat of the German
              office in the city and the central hub of the Hanseatic trade
              in Norway. The Hansa company was also the Nordic region's first
              trading company. The bridge consists of approx. 13 goals with 61
              protected buildings, [1] and located on UNESCO's list of world
              heritage sites. Bryggen is the third most visited tourist
              attraction in Norway.

              In the 19th century, Bergen was Europe's largest wooden town,
              a distinctive urban environment with dense wooden houses, busy
              streets, squares and alleys. At the Old Bergen open-air museum
              you can relive some of the mood, with houses from the 1700s,
              1800s and 1900s. How did it look? What did the people talk about?

              Fløyfjellet or Fløyen is one of Bergen's most popular mountain
              attractions, and one of Bergen's most popular tourist attractions.
              The view of Bergen from the viewpoint at Fløyen station
              Fløyfjellet is first and foremost the name of the mountain top,
              which is 400 meters above sea level and is located directly above
              Bergen city center. The name may be from the whistle bar, a
              windshield or weather rack that was raised to give a signal of
              the wind direction when ships were to leave Vågen. The view of the
              mountain peninsula makes Fløyfjellet a popular destination for
              both tourists and the local people. The Fløyfjellet is also a
              hiking trail that runs in a loop from Fløien station.
