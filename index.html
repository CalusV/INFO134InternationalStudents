            Hi there! If you found your way to this page, we guess you are a new
            visiter/student to Norway, and maybe feel a bit confused and displaced
            at the moment. Considering the cold weather, cold and unsociable people,
            and all in all coldness, there can actually arise a tender and warming
            aura from these encapsulated cold residents of Norway. Read further on
            for information about this page, and how you can benefit from it.
          </p>
          <h2>Site Information</h2>
          <p>
            <!-- -->
            On this page you will find a guide on how to get to know norwegians,
            how norwegian behavior is recommended to be perceived, and how to build
            a magical sphere that warms and supports an underlying understanding
            between two people that needs no explanation. Wow, that sounded weird.
            Anyways, you will also find more practical needs, like a map of all the toilets
            that are available in the city in case of an emergancy. Information about
            toiletgender and if a spesific toilet is free for use. We also have another map
            containing locations in the city we consider important to an International
            student or a visiter. These are places like liquer stores, which are apparently
            really important if you want to access the getMyAttention() method
            written as private within all norwegians. Well, at least until liquer is involved.
            Shopping mall, and relevant students quarters are also included.
            Great places to get to know your new friends!
          </p>
          <h2>The Map page</h2>
          <p>
            The map pages are very handy, and can help you get going on your journey
            to this distant land. If you go to the <a href="map.html">map</a> page and
            choose a category, a list of commendations will appear. From here you can
            view a small description of the location, and mark its position on the map.
            We recommend giving this page a try. Go outside, make your marks, and take a
            walk from one to the other. Its a beautiful city and it will charm you. If its
            raining, we will just warn you now, rain is pretty much present all the time in
            this city, so you can not let this be a dealbraker for taking some fresh air.
            This will only result in very long days sitting inside and staring at the
            apartment wall d[*_*]b. Just remember, if you are used to greet
            strangers with "Hi! How are you to day?", dont expect a response. Its not
            that they are angry, its just that you dont have access to their private variable
            "heart" yet.
          </p>
